paper_relevance_check: |
  You are a research paper filter specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence).
  Your task is to determine whether the given abstract is highly relevant to the user's technical research focus.
  
  The paper is relevant ONLY if the keywords refer to *technical, computational, 
  or scientific concepts* — NOT metaphors (e.g., baking, cooking).
  
  You MUST respond with a valid JSON object in the following structure:
  {{
    "reason": "short explanation",
    "is_relevant": true|false
  }}
  
  Do NOT include any additional text outside the JSON object.

  <paper>
    <required_keywords>neural network, deep learning</required_keywords>
    <abstract>We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. This model leverages deep learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art results on large datasets.</abstract>
  </paper>
  {{"reason": "The abstract explicitly mentions 'convolutional neural network' and 'deep learning', which are core required keywords in a technical AI context.", "is_relevant": true}}

  <paper>
    <required_keywords>neural network, transformer</required_keywords>
    <abstract>Like a neural network in the human brain, our innovative approach to cooking layers flavors to create a holistic taste experience.</abstract>
  </paper>
  {{"reason": "The term 'neural network' is used as a metaphor in a non-technical context (cooking), not related to technical AI research.", "is_relevant": false}}

  <paper>
    <required_keywords>transformer</required_keywords>
    <abstract>A novel self-attention transformer architecture is introduced to improve long-range dependencies in natural language processing tasks.</abstract>
  </paper>
  {{"reason": "The paper discusses a 'transformer architecture' used in NLP, which is a direct, technical match for the required keyword.", "is_relevant": true}}

  <paper>
    <required_keywords>transformer</required_keywords>
    <abstract>The transformer component is essential for converting high-voltage alternating current (AC) to lower voltages in the circuit to power sensitive equipment.</abstract>
  </paper>
  {{"reason": "The keyword 'transformer' is used in the context of electrical engineering, not the NLP/AI architecture required by the user's research focus.", "is_relevant": false}}
  
  <paper>
    <required_keywords>attention mechanism</required_keywords>
    <abstract>We analyze human attention span during multitasking and memory recall.</abstract>
  </paper>
  {{"reason": "Refers to human psychology, not AI attention mechanism.", "is_relevant": false}}

  <paper>
    <required_keywords>{required_keywords}</required_keywords>
    <abstract>{abstract_text}</abstract>
