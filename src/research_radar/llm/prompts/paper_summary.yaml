  <data>
  Question: What is the main problem?
  Answer: The paper addresses the high computational cost of training large language models.

  Question: What is the proposed solution?
  Answer: They introduce 'Sparse-Train', a technique that skips 50% of gradient calculations.

  Question: What are the key results?
  Answer: Training time was reduced by 40% with no loss in accuracy.

  <summary>
  This paper addresses the high computational cost of training large language models by introducing 'Sparse-Train', a technique designed to skip 50% of gradient calculations.
  The authors demonstrate that this approach reduces training time by 40% while maintaining model accuracy.

  INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Write a SINGLE, flowing paragraph.
  2. Do NOT use bullet points.
  3. Do NOT simply list the answers; connect them logically (e.g., "Consequently...", "Furthermore...").
  4. Do NOT explicitly say "The question asked..." or " The answer is...".
